# Crazy Cattle 3D - Comprehensive Game Information

> Crazy Cattle 3D is a free online browser game where you control crazy cattle in a physics-based 3D action environment. Play instantly without download, directly in your web browser.

## Game Overview

Crazy Cattle 3D is an independently developed battle royale game featuring explosive physics-based gameplay. Unlike traditional battle royale games that focus on weapon collection, Crazy Cattle 3D creates a unique gaming experience through momentum and collision mechanics.

The game offers three distinct environments: the rolling hills of Ireland, volcanic Iceland, and mountainous New Zealand. Each map provides unique strategic opportunities and terrain challenges. Players control explosive sheep (despite the "cattle" name) and must master momentum-based attacks to eliminate opponents.

While the learning curve may be steep for newcomers, the game's physics system delivers a deeply satisfying experience once mastered. The game requires no downloads and runs directly in modern web browsers, making it accessible from virtually any device with sufficient processing power.
